    "A single layer perceptron can be thought of as a linear hyperplane as in logistic regression followed by a non-linear activation function. $$u_{i} = \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{d} \\theta_{ij}x_{j}+b_{i}$$  $$o_{i} = \\phi \\left( \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{d} \\theta_{ij}x_{j}+b_{i} \\right) = \\phi(\\theta_{i}^{T}x+b_{i})$$ where $x$ is a d-dimensional vector i.e. $x \\in R^{d}$. It is one datapoint with $d$ features. $\\theta_{i} \\in R^{d}$ is the weight vector for the $i^{th}$ hidden unit, $b_{i} \\in R$ is the bias element for the $i^{th}$ hidden unit and $\\phi(.)$ is a non-linear activation function that has been described below. $u_{i}$ is a linear combination of the features in $x$ weighted by $\\theta_{i}$ whereas $o_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ output unit from the activation layer. \n",

    "## Fully connected Layer\n",
    "Typically, a modern neural network contains millions of perceptrons as the one shown in the previous image. Perceptrons interact in different configurations such as cascaded or parallel. In this part, we describe a fully connected layer configuration in a neural network which comprises multiple parallel perceptrons forming one layer. \n",

Similarly, $o^{[l-1]}$ is the n-dimensional output vector corresponding to the hidden units of the $(l-1)^{th}$ activation layer. $\\theta^{[l]} \\in R^{m \\times n}$ is the weight matrix of the $l^{th}$ layer where each row of $\\theta^{[l]}$ is analogous to $\\theta_{i}$ described in the previous section i.e. each row corresponds to one hidden unit of the $l^{th}$ layer. $b^{[l]} \\in R^{m}$ is the bias vector of the layer where each element of b pertains to one hidden unit of the $l^{th}$ layer. This is followed by element wise non-linear activation function $o^{[l]} = \\phi(u^{[l]})$.\n",

    "## Activation Function \n",
    "There are many activation functions in the literature but for this question we are going to use Relu, Sigmoid and Tanh only. \n",

    "The rectified linear unit (Relu) is one of the most commonly used activation functions in deep learning models. The mathematical form is $$o = \\phi(u) = max(0,u)$$<br> The derivative of relu function is given as $o' = \\phi'(u) = \\begin{cases}\n",

    "The sigmoid function is another non-linear function with S-shaped curve. This function is useful in the case of binary classification as its output is between 0 and 1. The mathematical form of the function is $$o = \\phi(u)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-u}}$$<br> The derivation of the sigmoid function has a nice form and is given as $$o' = \\phi'(u) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-u}} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{1+e^{-u}}\\right) = \\phi(u)(1-\\phi(u))$$\n",

    "Tanh also known as hyperbolic tangent is like a shifted version of sigmoid activation function with its range going from -1 to 1. Tanh almost always proves to be better than the sigmoid function since the mean of the activations are closer to zero. Tanh has an effect of centering data that makes learning for the next layer a bit easier. The mathematical form of tanh is given as $$o = \\phi(u) = tanh(u) = \\frac{e^{u} - e^{-u}}{e^{u} + e^{-u}}$$ The derivative of tanh is given as $$o' = \\phi'(u) = 1 - {\\left(\\frac{e^{u} - e^{-u}}{e^{u} + e^{-u}}\\right)}^{2} = 1 - o^{2}$$\n",

    "## Cross Entropy Loss\n",
    "An essential piece in training a neural network is the loss function. The whole purpose of gradient descent algorithm is to find some network parameters that minimizes the loss function. In this exercise, we minimize Cross Entropy (CE) loss that represents on an intuitive level the distance between true data distribution and estimated distribution by neural network. So during training of the neural network, we will be looking for network parameters that minimizes the distance between true and estimated distribution. The mathematical form of the CE loss is given by \n",
    "$$CE(p,q) = -\\sum\\limits_{i} p(x_{i})\\log q(x_{i}) $$\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "A frequentist estimate of $p(x_{i})$ can be written as $$p(x_{i})= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{y_{i}}{N}$$ Therefore, the cross entropy for binary estimation can be written as \n",
    "$$CE(y_{i},\\hat{y_{i}}) = -\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}\\left(y_{i} \\log (\\hat{y_{i}}) +(1-y_{i}) \\log (1-\\hat{y_{i}})\\right)$$\n",

    "## Forward Propagation\n",
    "We start by initializing the weights of the fully connected layer using Xavier initialization [Xavier initialization](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf). During training, we pass all the data points through the network layer by layer using forward propagation. The main equations for forward prop have been described below. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Backward propagation\n",
    "After the forward pass, we do back propagation to update the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. So, we update the weights and biases using the following formulas\n",

    "To compute the terms $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\theta^{[i]}}$ and $ \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial b^{[i]}}$ we use chain rule for differentiation as follows:\n",

    "Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research. In this part, you will build a convolutional neural network based on Keras to solve the image classification task for MINIST. If you haven't installed TensorFlow, you can install the package by **pip** command or train your model by uploading HW4 notebook to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) directly. Colab contains all packages you need for this section.  \n",

In an attempt to decrease the variance of a decision tree, we're going to use a technique called 'Bootstrap Aggregating' (often abbreviated 'bagging').

    "### 3.3 Plotting Feature Importance (5pts) <span style=\"color:green\">**[W]**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "While building tree-based models, it's common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in a decision tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practicioners typically use \"Gini importance\", or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in a decision tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the decision tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what this metric means with an example. A high probabiity of reaching a split on \"TrafficType\" in a decision tree trained on our e-commerce dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on \"TrafficType\" will result in a high feature importance value for \"TrafficType\". This could mean \"TrafficType\" is a very important feature for predicting a customer's revenue session. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on \"Month\" in a decision tree (few samples will reach this split for a decision) and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on \"Month\" will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean \"Month\" is not a very informative feature for predicting the revenue session in our decision tree. **Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.DecisionTreeClassifier to a dataset auomatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the decision tree and stores these values in a **feature_importances_** variable. [Review the docs for more details on how to access this variable](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.feature_importances_)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function below, display a bar plot that shows the feature importance values for at least one decision tree in your tuned random forest from Q3.2, and briefly comment on whether any features have noticeably higher / or lower importance weights than others. [Note that there isn't a \"correct\" answer here. We simply want you to investigate how different features in your random forest contribute to predicting the target variable].\n"
