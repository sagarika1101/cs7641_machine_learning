    "\n",
    "- This assignment consists of both programming and theory questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q4 is bonus for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To switch between cell for code and for markdown, see the menu -> Cell -> Cell Type\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You can directly type Latex equations into markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typing with Latex\\markdown is required for all the written questions. Handwritten answers will not be accepted. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- If a question requires a picture, you could use this syntax $\"<img src=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\"$ to include them within your ipython notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the autograder\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will find two assignments on Gradescope that correspond to HW2: \"HW2 - Programming\" and \"HW2 - Non-programming\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will submit your code for the autograder on \"HW2 - Programming\" in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * kmeans.py\n",
    "    * gmm.py\n",
    "    * semisupervised.py\n",
    "\n",
    "- All you will have to do is to copy your implementations of the classes \"Kmeans\", \"GMM\", \"CleanData\", \"SemiSupervised\" onto the respective files. We provided you different .py files and we added libraries in those files please DO NOT remove those lines and add your code after those lines. Note that these are the only allowed libraries that you can use for the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are allowed to make as many submissions until the deadline as you like. Additionally, note that the autograder tests each function separately, therefore it can serve as a useful tool to help you debug your code if you are not sure of what part of your implementation might have an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the \"HW2 - Non-programming\" part, you will download your jupyter notbook as html and submit it as a PDF on Gradescope. To download the notebook as PDF, click on \"File\" on the top left corner of this page and select \"Download as > PDF\". The non-programming part corresponds to Q2, Q3.3 (both your response and the generated images with your implementation) and Q4.2**\n",
    "- **When submitting to Gradescope, please make sure to mark the page(s) corresponding to each problem/sub-problem.**"

    "## Silhouette Coefficient Evaluation [10 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "The average silhouette of the data is another useful criterion for assessing the natural number of clusters. The silhouette of a data instance is a measure of how closely it is matched to data within its cluster and how loosely it is matched to data of the neighbouring cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters."

    "\n",
    "One of the limitations of K-Means Clustering is that it dependes largely on the shape of the dataset. A common example of this is trying to cluster one circle within another (concentric circles). A K-means classifier will fail to do this and will end up effectively drawing a line which crosses the circles. You can visualize this limitation in the cell below."

    "Ukiyo-e is a Japanese art genre predominant from the 17th through 19th centuries. In order to produce the intricate prints that came to represent the genre, artists carved wood blocks with the patterns for each color in a design. Paint would be applied to the block and later transfered to the print to form the image.\n",
    "In this section, you will use your GMM algorithm implementation to do pixel clustering and estimate how many wood blocks were likely used to produce a single print. That is to say, how many wood blocks would appropriatly produce the original paint. \n",

Stressing the importance of having minimum down time for refining, you have been tasked to find a way to predict whether a machine will need to be repaired or not. In order to aid you on the task, the company has supplied you with historical telemetric data from all of the machines. The features range from averages of temperature, frequencies, and other salient observations of the units. The specifics of the features are not pertinent to the classification; it can be assured that each feature is statistically significant. A unit is given a 1 if it is broken and a 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to a software bug in logging the telemetric data, 20% of the entries are missing labels and 30% are missing characterization data. Since simply removing the corrupted entries would not reflect the true variance of the data, your job is to implement a solution to clean the data so it can be properly classified. \n",
